# Employee_management
Employee Management API

Thanks for checking out Employee Management — a simple, no-frills API project built with Django that helps you manage employee data (create, read, update, delete). Whether you want to learn, test, or build something on top of it, you’re in the right place.

What is this

This is an API backend that supports basic operations related to employee records. You can use it to:

Add new employees

View/list existing employees

Modify employee details

Delete employees

The goal is simplicity: clean, straightforward, easy to extend.

Why I made this

To practice working with Django (models, serializers, views)

To build something useful and reusable

To have a small project that demonstrates REST principles

Tech stack

Here are the main tools & technologies used:

Technology	Purpose
Django (Python)	Web framework, ORM, routing, API structure
SQLite	Default DB for development/testing
Django REST Framework (likely)	For API endpoints, serialization etc.
Getting started

Here’s how you can set this up on your local machine.

Prerequisites

Python (version 3.x)

pip (package installer)

(Optional) virtual environment tool like venv or virtualenv

Setup steps

Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/Snigdha977/Employee_management.git
cd Employee_management


Create and activate a virtual environment

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate     # (Mac/Linux)
env\Scripts\activate        # (Windows)


Install requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt


Apply migrations

python manage.py migrate


(Optional) Create a superuser if you want to use Django’s admin

python manage.py createsuperuser


Run the development server

python manage.py runserver


Open your browser or use tools like Postman / curl to hit the endpoints (see below).

Usage / API Endpoints

Here are some of the endpoints you might find (adjust names/paths if different):

Endpoint	HTTP Method	Description
/employees/	GET	List all employees
/employees/	POST	Create a new employee
/employees/<id>/	GET	Get details of a specific employee
/employees/<id>/	PUT/PATCH	Update / partially update an employee
/employees/<id>/	DELETE	Remove an employee

You may need to send JSON bodies like:

{
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "position": "Developer",
  "salary": 50000
}


And you’ll get back JSON responses with the employee data (or an error if something goes wrong).

What’s present in the repo

app/ or similar folder: Django app(s) with models, views, serializers (if using DRF)

manage.py: Django’s command-line utility

db.sqlite3: SQLite database (for development)

Possibly requirements.txt: lists Python dependencies

Possible improvements / To-Dos

Here are some ideas for what you (or I) can add later:

Authentication (so only authorised users can add/update/delete)

Validation (better error messages, edge case handling)

Pagination for listing employees

Search/filtering (by name, department etc.)

Move to a more robust database for production (PostgreSQL etc.)

Docker support to simplify setup

How you can help / contribute

If you want to contribute, here’s how:
